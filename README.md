## :eye: About me
As a Software QA Engineer, I am responsible for creating, executing, and automating test cases and scenarios for web-based applications, using tools such as Selenium, Java. I work with a scrum team to ensure that the product meets user story and design intent, and I review test results and spot check for efficiency and coverage.

I have 3+ years of experience in both manual and automated testing, covering various types of testing such as functional, regression, integration, system, smoke, and user acceptance testing. I have also participated in collection workshops, analysed product requirements and specifications, and prepared campaigns and validated the final results before going into production. I have a Software Engineer degree from ENSIAS, where I studied web and mobile computing engineering, and I have completed multiple online courses and certifications in full-stack. I am passionate about learning new skills and applying them to daily tasks, improving productivity and quality. I am also a Global Ambassador at WomenTechNet, where I promote diversity and inclusion in the tech industry.
